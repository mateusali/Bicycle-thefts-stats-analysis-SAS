# Toronto Bicycle Theft Analysis ‚Äì SAS

This project explores **4 years of bicycle theft data in Toronto** using SAS for statistical analysis and visualization.  
The goal was to uncover patterns and insights related to **when, where, and how bicycles are stolen**, and to test relationships between different variables such as bike type, cost, season, and time of day.

## üß≠ Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Removed extreme outliers (below Q1, above Q3).
   - Reformatted categorical variables (bike type, premise type, weekdays vs weekends, time of day).
   - Created segmentations (seasons, cost ranges, reporting delays).

2. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Theft distribution by year, month, day, and hour.
   - Average cost & speed of stolen bikes.
   - Percentage of recovered bicycles.
   - Premises with most thefts (apartments & outdoor areas).

3. **Bivariate Analysis**
   - Growth of e-bike thefts from 2020‚Äì2024 (+135% until 2023, drop in 2024).
   - Bike cost vs day of week & time of day (no significant association).
   - Premises type vs season (statistically significant relationship).
   - Correlation between bike cost and speed (weak relationship).
   - Weekday vs weekend bike cost (weekends slightly higher, statistically significant).
